This project demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins, GitHub, and Nginx in a Windows environment. The objective is to automate the build and deployment of a web application whenever changes are pushed to a GitHub repository.

Modern software development requires faster release cycles and reliable deployment mechanisms. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment practices help achieve this by automating the build and deployment pipeline.

Jenkins is integrated with GitHub using webhooks to detect code changes and automatically trigger the deployment process. Nginx acts as the web server that hosts and serves the deployed application. This automated workflow ensures faster deployments, reduced manual intervention, improved consistency, and minimized human errors.

The project highlights the practical application of DevOps principles such as automation, continuous feedback, and streamlined deployment. It also demonstrates that open source DevOps tools can be effectively used in a Windows based infrastructure, providing a scalable foundation for future enhancements.
